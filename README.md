Deep learning systems (layered neural network architectures) are really good at prediction given an input. For instance, they may predict risk associated with a patient between 0-1 given huge vector representing patients information. But, they are just doing computation over input and these architecture don't support ways to tell why the machine made the decision. For instance, humans don't focus in pixel level. Looking at image of cat, they perviece pointed ears, deep eyes, white fur and small size (in comparison to table on the side), and recognize it as cat. When asked why, we can describe the reasons it's a house cat and not a wild siberian tiger who we can imagine as just a scaled version of house cat.

On the other hand, There are symbolic AI systems that can do causal reason of what causes what effect. They need an structured-relational data to act. To do so, again Human labelling would be necessary. Making traditional AI systems not Scalable and Limited. 
The Traditional AI can do causal reasoning over a data where higher level abstraction is provided in data. What we want instead is a deep learning system that can build model of the world at a higher level abstraction by learning from raw-information. 


Bengion provides following concepts that deep learning requires to move towards Human-Level AI. 
- Out-of-Order Distribution
- Attention
- Consiousness Prior

### [TrustML Seminar: Sara Magliacane on "Causality-inspired ML: what can causality do for ML?"] (https://youtu.be/X8foHlW-Dsw)

#### Summary : 

What can causality do for "TrustWorthy" Machine leanring ? 
- Fairness, Selection Bias, Generalization
- Heterogeneous data, small data, non i.i.d data
- Not just correlate input to output and do prediction, But Actionable insights. Decisions cannot be made with just prediction.

**Focuse with causality in light of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation** 
How can machine learning models generalize to distribution shifts outside training set domain ?
